_Talents_ are very similar to Traits, in fact a Trait can be applied as a Talent in CocktailJS.
 The main difference is that a Talent can be applied to an _object_ or _module_.
So we can define a Talent as a **Dynamically Composable Unit of Reuse**
(you can read more from [this paper](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Ress11a-Talents.pdf)).

> Note: While almost all functionality is implemented, the only missing part from the original paper is the ability to remove a Talent from a given instance.

````javascript
var cocktail = require('cocktail'),
	Login    = require('./trait/login'),
	user     = require('./user');

cocktail.mix(user, {
	'@talents': [Login]
});
