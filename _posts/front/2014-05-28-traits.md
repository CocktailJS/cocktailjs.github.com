_Traits_ are **Composable Units of Behaviour** (You can read more from [this paper](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Scha03aTraits.pdf)).
Basically, a Trait is a Class, but a special type of Class that has only behaviour (methods) and no state.
Traits are an alternative to reuse behaviour in a more predictable manner. They are more robust than _Mixins_, or
_Multiple Inheritance_ since name collisions must be solved by the developer beforehand. If you compose your class
with one or more Traits and you have a method defined in more than one place, your program will fail giving no magic rule
or any kind of precedence definition.

````javascript
var cocktail = require('cocktail'),
	Login    = require('./trait/login');

cocktail.mix({
	'@exports': module,
	'@as': 'class',
	'@traits': [Login]
});
