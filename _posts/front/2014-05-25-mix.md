The entry point in Cocktail is a method named **mix()**. As in any cocktail, you
mix things up. In the mix we can use an existing Object, Module or Class reference
and mix it to add more value, like adding more properties or even methods.

>Mix Object Example

````javascript
var cocktail = require('cocktail'),
	obj = {
		name: 'My Object'
	};

cocktail.mix(obj, {
	value: 10,
	print: function() {
		console.log(this.name + ' ' + this.value);
	}
});

obj.print(); //MyObject 10

```
